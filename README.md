A simple web application that serves as an event booking platform. Users can register as either 'Organizer' or 'User.' Organizers have tools to create, edit, and manage their events, as well as subscribe to other events. Users can easily register, sign up for events, and search for available events. Additionally, there is an 'Admin Panel' for site administrators, where they can view users, events, subscribers, and check site statistics.

Here some screen of the site:
